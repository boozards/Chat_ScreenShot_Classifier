# Chat_ScreenShot_Classifier
This convolutional neural network can predict if an input image is a chat screen-shot or a normal image. I have trained the model on 527 training images and tested on 132 test images. After 5 epochs it reached a training set accuracy more than 99% and a test set accuracy more than 98%. 

# Motivation : 
I have a couple of friends who used to send me a lot of chat screen-shots. Gradually my phone gallery became filled with them. So I thought it would be nice if I can make a model which can separate the chat screen-shots from other images for me :P
